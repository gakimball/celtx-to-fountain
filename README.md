# celtx-to-fountain

JavaScript script that converts a [Celtx](https://www.celtx.com/) screenplay file into a [Fountain](https://www.fountain.io/) document.

I only have two old screenplays to test it with, so the script probably doesn't cover every Celtx feature or formatting edge case.

Currently, the script can convert:

- Scene headings
- Actions
- Characters
  - Parentheticals
  - Dialog
- Scene transitions
